### Automation Scripts


## :gear: Installation
To preface, I'm using a Windows 10 machine to do the following:
* Upon creating the Automation Scripts directory, I added the directory to the PATH environment variable
* Run the following command to install all library dependencies
    ```pip install pyperclip```
