### Automation Scripts
A series of Python scripts I've created and experimented with, following the textbook [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/), that seek to automate everyday, repetitive computer tasks. Examples include:
* Automatically sorting files into folders
* Excel and CSV file manipulation
* Web Scraping
* Searching via the Google Maps API

## :gear: Installation
To preface, I'm using a Windows 10 machine to do the following:
* Upon creating the Automation Scripts directory, I added the directory to the PATH environment variable
* Run the following command to install all library dependencies
    ```pip install pyperclip```
